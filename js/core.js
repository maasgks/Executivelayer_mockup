/* == ACCOUNT MANAGER — CLIENT-FACING PIPELINE ============================================
   The nine statuses the client actually sees, in the order they see them, split across the
   two tracks the work runs on: the engagement track happens once per client request, the
   placement track repeats for every hire made under a signed engagement. Stage 6 is a
   payment gate rather than a step — nothing downstream moves until the deposit clears — so
   it carries `gate` and renders differently from the eight stages that simply progress.

   Three labels per stage, because three audiences read this data. `label` is the client-
   facing wording, shown wherever the client's own view is being represented. `short` is the
   same state compressed to fit inside a status badge — the full sentences are far too long
   for a table cell. `internal` is what the Account Manager needs to know about the state,
   which the client is never shown. == */
/* Three names per stage, for three readers, and the reason they differ is the whole design:
     label  what the CLIENT is shown — verbatim from the operating model, never reworded here
     short  what WE call it in the app — plain English, no jargon, fits a narrow column
     plain  what it MEANS, in a sentence a new user can read without training
   The old short names failed the third test badly. "Requested / Quoting / In review /
   Approved / Signature / Contract / Active" gave a newcomer no way to tell which side was
   holding the work, and used two words ("Signature", "Contract") for two different signings
   by two different people. Naming the signer instead — "Client signing", "Worker signing" —
   removes that collision without a legend. */

/* == ADMIN SUB-STATUSES ==================================================================
   The operational steps inside each client-facing stage. These are INTERNAL and must never
   reach a client-visible surface — the sub-steps themselves are why. "Partner cost requested"
   discloses that we do not own the country and are sourcing through a partner. "Pricing
   approval (if off-standard)" discloses that the client was quoted off-book. "Client entity
   + sanctions check" discloses that they were screened. Each is commercially or legally
   sensitive on its own, so the client sees only the nine parent stages and never this layer.

   `owner` is per sub-step, not per stage, because that is what gates who may advance it. The
   source table gives compound owners for some stages ("EOR Ops · Pricing", "System · AM") and
   the split only makes sense at sub-step level: Pricing owns the pricing approval, EOR Ops
   owns the cost build. `cond` marks a step that only applies in some cases and renders muted,
   `decision` a branch point, `loop` a step that can legitimately repeat.

   `auto` marks a step the AI Execution Layer performs itself — `autoNote` says by what. The
   dividing line: lookups, generation from templates/data, dispatch, and webhook-confirmed
   facts automate; judgment, liability and signatures do not. So "CSM assigned" automates (a
   country-to-CSM routing table needs no human), but "Qualified / Disqualified" never does —
   that is the one decision stage 1 exists to make. `owner` stays on auto steps on purpose:
   automation changes who does the work, not who answers for it. == */

/* == EVIDENCE FOR EACH SUB-STATUS ========================================================
   amSubStatuses says WHAT each step is and WHO owns it. This says what the machine actually
   did: which system it reached, what came back, which rule it checked, the verdict, and what
   it wrote to the record.

   It is a SEPARATE map keyed '<stageId>/<label>', never extra keys on amSubStatuses — the
   pipeline board, the deal drawer, the Workflow tab and the derived log all read those
   objects, and none of them should have to carry presentation data. The label is the key
   because the label is already a sub-step's identity everywhere else in the app.

   call / fetched / checks / captured may each be a function of ctx, so figures read live from
   the contract being built rather than being frozen at authoring time.

   WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS AUTHORED. The rule rows, rates, statuses, country data, agent
   names and people are all real values from elsewhere in this app — if a step names the
   Netherlands minimum wage it says EUR 14.71, because that is what Compliance Hub -> Rates &
   Rules says two clicks away, and a demo that shows two different numbers for one fact is
   worse than one that shows fewer. What IS authored is the shape of the work: endpoints,
   payload counts, latencies and the phrasing of each check. Those are invented, but never
   inventing a new system, agent or person — only ever describing a request to something the
   product already names. == */

/* == OPS MANAGER — BHAIYAA STORE OPERATIONS ==============================================
   The same instrument as the Account Manager board above — header, rail, listing, drawer —
   pointed at a different journey. Everything it shows is the Bhaiyaa Store Creation Journey
   (aiJourneyEvents['bhaiyaa-store-creation']) and nothing else: five stages, in the order the
   journey declares them, with the same owners the journey names.

   WHY THIS SHAPE FOR THIS ROLE. An Ops Manager's day on store openings is not a to-do list of
   their own steps — the journey is 3 of 5 steps automated, and the two human steps belong to
   the merchant. Their day is the two exceptions the journey itself calls out: a merchant who
   started a signup and stopped, and an agent run that halted. So the board is built to make
   those two visible, and it deliberately does NOT invent ops sign-off steps to pad the human
   column. Padding would have made the automated journey look manual, which is the one thing
   this product should never do.

   MINIMAL ON PURPOSE. Twelve sub-steps across five stages, against the contract journey's 41.
   The store journey is short and mostly automated; a board that split it into forty operations
   would be describing a process that does not exist. == */

/* == SUB-STEPS ===========================================================================
   Same contract as amSubStatuses: `auto` is performed by the execution layer, `owner` is who
   answers for it either way, `cond` marks a step that only applies in some cases.

   `halt` is new here, and it earns its place. The journey documents two failures that stop a
   run dead — a UIDAI mismatch and a rejected Bhaiyaa registration — and both are handed to a
   person to clear. Modelling them as ordinary steps would put every store through a compliance
   review it does not need; modelling them as nothing would leave the two records an Ops Manager
   actually works with nowhere to sit. So a halt step exists only for a record whose run halted
   in that stage (see soSteps), and it is the LAST step of its stage, which is what keeps `sub`
   indices stable whether it is present or not.

   `act` overrides the button wording. "Mark done" is right for a step you complete and wrong
   for one you clear, and the listing's action column is the place a user reads fastest — so
   these are kept to two words, which is what the column can hold without truncating. == */

   The signup fields as they come back from seller.bhaiyaa, keyed by our store ref. A separate
   table from soRuns above, and deliberately so: soRuns is OUR journey state — which stage, which
   step, whether it stopped — and none of that exists in Bhaiyaa. This is the other half, the
   half we only ever read. Keeping them apart is what makes the boundary visible, and it is the
   shape the real integration wants: this table is the one that gets replaced by an API response.

   These are the values the KYC screen verifies against. They are here rather than on the run
   because a run that has not reached KYC has no reason to carry an Aadhaar number around. == */

  /* == THE SAAS PRODUCT'S OWN MODULES =====================================================
     Seven domain groups, each one an answer to "whose job is this". The previous shape grouped
     by noun — an "Employee" dropdown holding two views of the same list, a "Leaves" dropdown —
     which left the pages of pre-employment legal setup split across "Workforce Operations" and
     "Compliance Hub" for no reason a user could name, and Payroll under a heading whose other
     children were timesheets and contracts.

     What changed, and why:
       Workforce          Employees + Teams. Direct and Global were never two modules, only two
                          filters over one list, so they are one nav item with the filter inside
                          the page (see buildEmployeesPageHTML).
       Client & Contracts The commercial chain, in the order it happens: create the client,
                          browse clients, then their contracts, then the templates behind them.
                          Client used to be a module of its own one row up, which put the record
                          and the contract written against it in different places.
       Compliance Hub     Its own module again. Compliance Items and Rates & Rules are reference
                          data an entity maintains once and reads against many contracts — a
                          different rhythm from the per-deal work above, and a different owner.
       Time & Payroll     Everything that feeds a pay run. My/All Timesheet collapse the same
                          way Employees did — one page, two tabs.
       Finance            Payments alone, deliberately. Client billing has a different owner
                          (Finance) than payroll (Ops/HR), and the domain map has it growing
                          into invoices, vouchers and receivables — folding it into Payroll now
                          to save one row would only have to be undone.
       Administration     Company Settings + Users. "All Users" loses its qualifier; under an
                          Administration heading, "Users" is unambiguous.
       Support            Untouched, on purpose. == */

  /* == BHAIYAA STORE CREATION ============================================================
     Four stages, and the split between them is the design: each one is a different KIND of
     work, so each earns its own screen rather than being a line in one long feed.

       Store Details   data entry — the merchant's own signup
       KYC             an identity check the agent performs against UIDAI — not data entry,
                       not provisioning, and the one stage that can genuinely fail, so it is
                       shown on its own rather than buried mid-run where a failure would
                       scroll past
       Store Creation  the automation: fetch, derive, mint, register, provision
       Store Created   the record

     The rail carries all four from the first screen, so a merchant on step 1 can already see
     that an Aadhaar check is coming — which is the difference between asking for an Aadhaar
     number and springing it on them.

     WHAT WAS REMOVED. A fifth stage used to open this journey, asking whether the store sells
     to customers or buys from sellers. It is gone: the signup this mirrors is seller.bhaiyaa.com,
     which signs up sellers and nothing else, so it was a screen with one real answer standing
     between a merchant and the form they came to fill. The `role` field survives on the store
     record — anything already created, and anything arriving from Bhaiyaa carrying a buyer role,
     still reads correctly everywhere. What went is the question, not the column. == */

/* == BHAIYAA — STORE CREATION JOURNEY ======================================================
   The signup Bhaiyaa asks a merchant for, rendered here so a store can be opened from inside the
   Executive Layer instead of on Bhaiyaa's own site. Same field-definition shape as the NewForce
   intake above, plus three things that form needs and NewForce's does not:

     hint     Bhaiyaa writes a line of help under three of its fields. They are not decoration —
              "you can change this later" and "this decides your annual turnover band" are the
              two facts that stop a merchant stalling on a choice, so they are part of the field.
     verify   The mobile number is the one field with a state machine behind it (send OTP, enter
              code, verified). Declaring it here keeps the renderer generic.
     consent  T&C and MSA are not checkboxes that gate a button, they are evidence. Both are
              recorded on the store record with the timestamp they were accepted at.

   Ordering follows Bhaiyaa's own form exactly: who you are, then how we reach you, then what the
   store is. A merchant filling this alongside Bhaiyaa's site should never have to hunt.

   SECTIONS. The live signup at seller.bhaiyaa.com/sign-up spreads these over seven screens —
   phone auth, account, KYC, bank, location, delivery, OTP. This flow keeps its own four stages
   (see bhaiyaaStoreStages) and folds all of the merchant-entered ones into stage 1, because a
   four-stage rail that suddenly grew to eleven would be describing the form's pagination rather
   than the journey. What it does NOT do is stack thirty controls in one column: each field
   declares a `section`, and the renderer draws a titled group per section. The grouping is
   Bhaiyaa's own — a merchant filling both should recognise every block. == */
