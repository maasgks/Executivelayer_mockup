/* == CONTRACT CREATION JOURNEY — REBUILT FROM SCRATCH ====================================
   A second, independent implementation of the contract-creation journey, built one stage at a
   time. It shares nothing with the original ai-contract-* chain in js/pages.js beyond
   read-only domain data (amPipelineStages, amSubStatuses, aicjEvidence, AI_CT_COUNTRIES) and
   two pure helpers (parseAIContractPrompt, findExistingEmployee) — no shared state, no shared
   render path, no shared page ids. The original keeps working untouched and stays available as
   reference for as long as this one is being built.

   NAMING. Everything here is prefixed `ccj` — functions, state, page ids and CSS classes.
   `cc` alone belongs to the cost calculator (ccRender, .cc-row, ccSalary) and `aicj` to the
   original journey's sub-status runner, so a third prefix is what keeps the three from
   colliding in a codebase where every script shares one global scope.

   == THE SPINE: NINE STAGES, EACH OWNING SEVERAL SCREENS ================================
   The nine client-facing stages in amPipelineStages are the journey. A stage is NOT one
   screen — stage 1 alone walks through four:

     prompt    describe the hire, in conversation
     employee  the ADT record we created, when the person was not already there
     form      Create a Contract — every field, AI pre-filled
     proposal  the compiled proposal

   `page` stays on the stage (`ccj-request-received`) for all four; `ccjRun.screen` is what
   moves. THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT: the shell — header, rail and above all the sub-status panel
   — is built once when the stage is entered, and changing screens repaints ONLY #ccj-screen.
   The panel is never rebuilt, never remounted and never loses its place. It stays as it is
   until every sub-status in the stage has completed, and only then does the journey advance.

   == THE PANEL: A QUARTER OF THE WIDTH, TOP TO BOTTOM ===================================
   A vertical card pinned to the right at 25% of the body. Every sub-status shows its detail,
   stacked in order: what a settled one found, what the running one is doing right now, and
   what a pending one will do when it gets there. Nothing is hidden behind a disclosure — the
   whole stage is readable at a glance, and the full evidence (the call, the payload, every
   rule and verdict) is one click deeper in a drawer.

   == HOLDS: WHY "NEW INTAKE" DOES NOT FINISH IN THREE SECONDS ===========================
   Most sub-statuses are a burst of machine work: reach a system, check the rules, capture
   what came back, done. Some are not. `New intake` is the capture of the request itself, and
   the request is not captured until the contract details have been entered and compiled into
   a proposal — which takes as long as a person takes. So it runs its beats, then HOLDS:
   visibly current, spinner turning, evidence on screen, waiting on a milestone rather than a
   timer. Reaching the `proposal` screen releases it. Only then does CSM assigned run, and
   only after that does the qualification decision appear.

   That distinction — timed work versus held work — is the honest one. A sub-status that ticked
   green while the user still had an empty form in front of them would be reporting work that
   had not happened.                                                                       == */

/* ---- STAGES AND PAGES ---------------------------------------------------------------- */
/* A page id is derived from the stage id rather than listed, so the two can never drift:

   person was not already in ADT, exactly as the original journey behaves. `chat` says whether

/* == STAGE 3: SOMEBODY ELSE'S CLOCK =======================================================
   Stages 1 and 2 were internal — the agent does a thing, it takes 700ms, it is done. Stage 3
   is a quote sitting with a client for days, and that changes three things.

   TIME IS SIMULATED, AND SHOWN. The run advances in seconds; the timeline it writes says
   "4 Aug, 09:12 · Opened 11:20 · Follow-up 7 Aug". Real elapsed seconds would read as a
   stopwatch. Simulated stamps read as an engagement history, which is what this is.

   A FOLLOW-UP AND A NEGOTIATION ARE THE SAME EVENT. Each chase is a message to the client;
   the client's reply is a message back. So the panel COUNTS them and the thread SHOWS them —
   the same split the panel and the agent chat already use, applied to the client.

   THE PATH BRANCHES AND LOOPS. Accepted on first read settles two rows and marks three not
   applicable. A change request runs the negotiation, rebuilds the price, re-issues as v2 and
   goes BACK to waiting on a read. The rail never moves backwards; the loop is inside the
   stage, which is where the operating model puts it.                                     == */

   user's. Someone using the product already knows why they are being asked; the `ask` line says
   what to decide, and a second sentence restating it in grey reads as filler and makes a finished
   product look like a walkthrough of itself. Add one only where it carries a FACT the ask cannot:

   `reason` is what separates the two ways in.

   A NEGATIVE decision — every option marked tone:'stop' — may not be taken silently. Called from
   the card with no reason, this does not act: it asks for one, and the click that follows brings
   it back. Called WITH a reason, it acts. That is the whole mechanism.

   It is a second argument rather than a separate confirm-only entry point because the decision
   logic below must stay in one place. Two entry points into nine branches is how one of them ends
   up recording something the other does not, and the branch that quietly skips the record is the
   one nobody notices until someone asks why an engagement was killed.

   Why reasons at all: every branch below either ends an engagement or sends work back to be
   redone. Both are decisions a person is answerable for later, and until now not one of them
   captured a word about why. `releaseShort` was the sole exception — it recorded who released and
   how much was short — and it is the shape the other eight now follow.

/* ---- THE RAIL --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Numbered dots, because at nine stages an unlabelled circle gives no sense of position and
   the number is already what the header counts.

   A PHASE IS A CONTAINER, NOT A CAPTION. The first version set the two track names as small
   uppercase text floating above their run of dots, and it failed on the only question it
   existed to answer: a reader could see that the nine stages were split, and could not see
   WHY, or where the second half began. Two words hovering over dead space is not a grouping.
   Each half is now a box of its own — numbered 1 and 2, named by the document it produces
   (see amPipelineTracks), and carrying the rule that makes it a phase on the same line:
   "Signed once per client" against "Runs for every hire". That sentence is the whole reason
   the journey breaks in two, so it belongs on the face of the rail, not in a title attribute.

   Each box also counts ONLY ITSELF, and reports the count that is useful in its own state:
   how far through, while you are in it; that it is behind you, once it is; how much it will
   cost you, while it is still ahead. The header above already carries "Step 4 of 9" for the
   whole run, so repeating a global count here would have been the third place to read it. */
/* == THE RAIL: FOUR STEPS AT A TIME, NINE ON DEMAND ========================================
   Nine steps in two labelled phase boxes took a third of the page above a conversation that IS the
   product. Most of it was inert: seven of the nine steps are not the one you are on, and the boxes
   restated a grouping the step names already imply.

   So the default is a WINDOW of four, and it slides. The user set the behaviour exactly: start on
   1-4, hold there for step 2, and from step 3 the leftmost slides out while the next slides in —
   which keeps one step of context behind the current one and two ahead of it, at every point in the
   journey. The two phase boxes come back, with all nine, when the expand control is used.

   IT SLIDES RATHER THAN REDRAWS, and that is the whole implementation. All nine steps are always in
   the DOM; the track is translated. A rail rebuilt per stage would snap between positions however
   the CSS was written, because a transition needs the same element on both sides of the change —
   and a stage change here is a full page render, so the element is new every time. The previous
   position is therefore replayed onto the fresh element and the new one set a layout tick later:
   see ccjPaintRail. */

   column from the very top, and the window — four steps wide, the width the old right-hand phase
   box had — sits at the top of the RIGHT column, above the artefact. The window walks the whole
   journey: 1-4 at the start, holding through step 2, sliding one per step from step 3, so one step
   of context stays behind the current one and the clamp stops it at 6-9. The full nine-step rail
   with its phase groups comes back full-width when the arrow expands it, and the chat shortens
   underneath — that state is the one surface the sketch keeps from the old design. */

   but not TIME. The transition from new→old has made zero progress when the second write lands, so
   the second write is a no-op and the rail snaps. Measured, not assumed — the first version did
   exactly this and the browser check caught it by sampling mid-flight and finding the track already
   at its destination.

   So the element mounts where it was, and one timer tick later it is told where to go. By then the
   browser has painted the start value and the transition has something to run from.

   A real timer rather than requestAnimationFrame, because the headless harness stubs rAF as a noop
   — the callback would never fire and the rail would be left permanently at the old position.
   The fake clock DOES run timers, so the harness reaches the right end state on the next advance.

/* == WHICH STAGES HAVE BEEN REBUILT AS A TRANSCRIPT ======================================
   The sub-status panel is being replaced stage by stage, not all at once, and this list is the
   switch. A stage named here renders its sub-statuses as blocks INSIDE the conversation and has
   no panel; a stage not named here keeps the panel exactly as it was.

   Two reasons it is a list rather than a flag flipped once. The journey is rebuilt one stage at
   a time with the design agreed before each — so a stage nobody has designed yet must keep
   working, not half-change. And stages 3-6 talk to the CLIENT and 7-9 to the WORKER, where the
   conversation on screen is a counterparty's: putting internal sub-statuses into it would put
   "Partner cost requested" and "Pricing approval (if off-standard)" one line away from a message
   the client can see, and core.js is explicit that this layer must never reach a client surface.
   That needs a decision about separation before those stages move, and this list is what stops
   the decision being made by accident.

   honesty with less noise — the window shows only work that has actually finished, and the
   verb names only the action actually underway.

   THE VERB IS DERIVED, NOT AUTHORED. Every action ccjActsFor builds carries an id, and the id
   names the kind of work; a step whose evidence has no shape says "Working" and nothing more.
   During a hold the machine may still be busy (the intake parses a document there) but which
   action the verb would name is over, so it says "Working" rather than re-claiming the last
   verb for work that already finished. */

/* == A SUB-STATUS AS A BLOCK IN THE TRANSCRIPT ===========================================
   The same content the panel row carried, in the conversation instead of beside it, and showing
   one thing at a time rather than all of them at once.

   OPEN OR CLOSED. A block is open while the runner is ON it, and closes when the runner moves
   to the next one — not when it settles. That distinction is the whole behaviour: a step that
   has just finished stays open long enough to be read, and gives up the space only when there
   is something newer to give it to. Clicking a closed block opens it again, and that choice is
   remembered in run.open so the next repaint does not quietly undo it.

   WHAT A CLOSED BLOCK KEEPS. Its one useful fact, and never a bare tick — "CSM assigned ·
   Marta Reyes / NL". That line is not authored here; it is run.settled[key].summary, snapshotted
   when the step settled. Read from the snapshot rather than by calling ccjSummary again, or a
   line written in stage 1 would silently change as stage 7 moved.

   WHAT NEVER CLOSES. Anything still running — which is NOT just `hold`. A step waiting on the
   client is as unfinished as one holding on a milestone, and `wait` is a phase the declaring
   comment does not even list. A block showing an unanswered gate never closes either: closing it
   would hide the only control that can advance the run.

   NO PENDING BLOCKS. The panel showed every step of the stage up front, so a step that had not
   run yet had to say what it WOULD do (CCJ_PURPOSE). A transcript is a record of what happened;
   a step that has not started has no block at all. CCJ_PURPOSE stays — the onboarding screen
   still uses it for its pending cards — it is simply not read from here. == */
/* == PASSES: THE SAME STEP, RUN TWICE ====================================================
   Stage 2's Quote QA can send the run back to Cost calc built, and three steps then run AGAIN.
   That is the first thing in this journey the transcript could not describe: every per-step store
   is keyed 'stageId/label', so a second pass had nowhere to live and the re-run painted itself
   into the block the first pass was still sitting in — several screens above the message
   announcing it, while the bottom of the conversation went dead for eleven seconds.

   A pass number fixes it, and it has to be threaded through EVERY addresser at once. The block
   message, the open/closed state, the DOM id and the evidence-line id all take the pass, because
   two blocks sharing an id is the silent version of this bug: getElementById returns the FIRST
   match, so the second attempt's beats would paint into the first attempt's block with no error.

   run.settled is deliberately NOT keyed by pass. It is the runner's own store, read and deleted
   by code all over this file, and a second key shape there would be a much larger blast radius
   than this change is worth. A superseded block does not read it anyway — it is frozen. == */

   had — because their live state has just been deleted out from under them by the send-back.

   The first block of the attempt carries the fold; the rest render nothing, which is what the

   whether we carry an unfunded payroll.

/* == THE TRANSCRIPT: APPEND-ONLY, AND STICKY RATHER THAN FORCED ==========================
   The stream used to be rebuilt from run.msgs on every single push, then force-scrolled to the
   bottom. Both had to go, and for the same reason the sub-status panel is built once per stage:
   a surface that is thrown away and rebuilt cannot hold a spinner, an animation, a scroll
   position, or a reader's place in it.

   THE RULE. A message already on screen is never re-rendered. A push appends its own node and
   nothing else moves. The full rebuild survives as ccjRenderChat, but only for the moments that
   genuinely start a new surface: a page render, a switch between the agent, client and worker
   threads, and the one place in this file that edits history rather than adding to it
   (ccjPickClient, which drops its own question once it is answered).

   Nobody calls the right one by hand. Every push goes through ccjStreamSync, which appends when
   it can PROVE the DOM already holds exactly the messages before this one, and rebuilds when it
   cannot. A caller that had to know which it needed would eventually get it wrong, and getting
   it wrong is silent — an append onto a stale stream duplicates the conversation.

   STICKY BOTTOM, NOT FORCED BOTTOM. `el.scrollTop=el.scrollHeight` on every push meant a reader
   could not scroll up and read anything while the run was moving; every beat threw them back
   down. The follow now happens only if they were already at the bottom — and it is measured
   BEFORE the append, because appending is precisely what changes the number being measured. == */

  // at-the-bottom. That is the right answer for it: the tests care what the stream SAYS, and a
  // run that silently stopped following would be a browser-only bug either way.

/* FOLLOWING IS AN INTENT, NOT A MEASUREMENT.

   The first version asked "is the reader at the bottom?" at the moment it wanted to scroll — and
   that is always too late. By then the paint has already happened: a block has grown four
   evidence lines, or a whole new block has been appended, and the reader is two hundred pixels
   from a bottom that moved without them. The honest answer to the measurement is "no, they are
   not at the bottom", so the follow was skipped, and the run walked off the end of the screen
   while the thing it wanted the reader to answer sat below the fold.

   So it is remembered instead. The reader is following until they scroll UP, and following again
   the moment they come back to the bottom. Nothing the run does changes it; only they do.

   Our own scrolling has to be excluded, or the fix breaks itself: a glide toward the bottom
   passes through dozens of positions that are not the bottom, and each one would read as the
   reader deciding to leave. ccjAutoScroll counts the glides in flight and the listener ignores

/* == WHAT THE STREAM IS SHOWING, AND WHY IT IS ONE STREAM =================================
   Three stores, still three arrays. The client's thread and the worker's must never merge — one
   discusses our margin, the other discusses a person's salary with them, and either message in
   the other thread is a disclosure. That rule is about the DATA, and it is untouched here.

   What changes is the RENDER. Until stage 3 a counterparty stage swapped the column wholesale to
   that counterparty's thread, and the machine's own work went to the panel. With the panel gone
   they have to share a column, and the honest way to share it is one timeline: what we did and
   what was said, in the order it happened.

   Merged by `_id`, which costs nothing because ccjNextMsgId is a single run-wide counter and
   every store already draws from it — id order IS chronological order, across all three. That
   was not designed for this; it is a payoff from giving every message an id in the first place.

   Gated on ccjUsesTranscript, because stages 4-6 have not been rebuilt. They still show the
   counterparty's thread alone in a 300px column beside a panel, and pouring the internal stream
   into that column would put internal work in a client conversation with none of the marking
   that makes stage 3 safe to read. == */
/* ONE RECORD, ALL THE WAY DOWN. A rebuilt stage shows our own work AND BOTH counterparty threads,
   merged by id. Not just the counterparty of the stage you happen to be on — that was the first
   version, and it meant arriving at stage 7 silently deleted the client conversation from the
   scroll: the quote they negotiated, the invoice they paid and the replies to our own chase
   messages all vanished, leaving stage 6's blocks referring to messages no longer anywhere.

   A transcript that drops half of what it recorded is not a record. The user chose this outright
   when asked: one continuous record, with a divider where the counterparty changes.

   The three STORES are still three arrays and still never merge — that rule is about the data and
   is untouched. What is merged is a sorted view, and `_id` is a single run-wide counter, so id
   order is chronological order across all three without anything having to be timestamped. */

/* == TYPING ================================================================================
   The agent's messages arrive word by word rather than all at once, which is how a reader
   distinguishes something being composed from something being displayed.

   IT REVEALS, IT DOES NOT BUILD. The message is inserted complete and correct, and only then are
   its text nodes emptied and refilled. Building the string up character by character would mean
   the bubble spends most of its life holding half a tag — `<b>Cost calc bui` — and every message
   in this journey carries markup. Walking text nodes leaves the element tree untouched throughout,
   so bold stays bold and a link never briefly renders as its own source.

   ONE AT A TIME. If a message lands while another is still typing, the older one is completed
   immediately rather than left racing — two bubbles filling at once reads as a glitch, and the
   run's own pacing already assumes the reader has finished the previous line.

   INVISIBLE TO THE HARNESS, deliberately. Its DOM stub fabricates parentless nodes, which
   ccjLiveNode already refuses, so this never runs there and messages render whole. That is the
   correct outcome and not a workaround: the suite's job is to assert what the journey SAYS, and it
   would otherwise be reading a sentence that is still arriving. Typing is a browser behaviour and

   the person's name. "Hire Rohan Verma in Germany as an Operations Analyst" comes back as
   `Hire Rohan Verma as Operations Analyst` — the verb and the role end up inside the name, and
   the role itself is thrown away even though the sentence stated it.

   This one takes things OUT in order of how confidently they can be identified, and each pass
   removes what it claimed so the next cannot claim it again: engagement model, then country,
   then the role after "as", and only what survives all three is the name. That ordering is the
   whole trick — "in Germany as an Operations Analyst" only reduces cleanly once Germany is
   already gone.                                                                              */

/* ---- DOCUMENT PARSING --------------------------------------------------------------------
   Upload an offer letter, an ID or a filled-in form and the agent reads the contract out of it.

   WHY THIS IS ONE CARD AND NOT TWENTY-FOUR MESSAGES. The obvious way to show extraction is to
   replay the whole question flow against the document — ask for a field, answer it from the
   file, repeat. That is what the original journey did, and it costs two messages per field:
   twenty-four bubbles to report a single pass the machine made in one go. It reads as theatre,
   and worse, it buries the only thing a reviewer actually needs, which is not "what did you
   find" but "where did you get it".

   So extraction is ONE message that grows: a card listing each field as it lands, with the part
   of the document it was read out of. Each row carries that citation and nothing else.

   NO CONFIDENCE MARKER. An earlier version graded every row CERTAIN / LIKELY / GUESS. It was
   removed on the owner's call, and the call is right: the values are read straight from the
   document, so a row labelled LIKELY invites doubt about something that is not in doubt. The
   citation survives because it answers the question that remains useful — where this came from —
   without implying the answer might be wrong.

   The fields the document does not cover are named at the end rather than silently left blank,
   and the agent then asks for those in conversation exactly as it would have anyway.

   WHAT IT MAY OVERWRITE. Empty fields, and fields the AGENT pre-filled — a document is better
   evidence than an inference. Never a value the user typed. Their edit is the most recent
   human judgement on that field and nothing automatic outranks it.                          */

   products, shared the way amPipelineStages is. Only the one-line meaning is written here: what
   the ORIGINAL journey put on these cards described its own navigation ("Opens the AI Contract
   Assistant") rather than the engagement, and EOR and PEO are initialisms a client cannot decode

   the difference an engagement model, and being asked to pick one before being told what the
   options mean is the classic expert-shaped question. The card copy now names the PERSON — an EOR
   employee, a direct employee, a contractor — and the model is what that choice implies.

   Overridden HERE rather than edited into AI_CT_TYPE_CARDS, which is shared: js/pages.js reads
   `modelCard.title` for the original journey's header chip, and that journey is a frozen reference
   which must keep behaving exactly as it did. Same reason CCJ_MODEL_MEANS already overrides `desc`.

/* == STAGE 5: THE MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT ===============================================
   The commercial contract between ADT and the CLIENT COMPANY. Not the employment contract —
   that is between ADT and the WORKER, and it is stage 7. Two different contracts, two different
   counterparties, two different bodies of law, which is why the pipeline has two signing stages.

   The original journey rendered an EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT here, signed by the employee. It cannot
   be that: this stage's own sub-statuses include a client entity and sanctions check, and you do
   not sanctions-screen a candidate. You screen a company you are about to contract with.

   MASTER is the operative word. It is signed ONCE PER CLIENT and every later hire runs under it.
   That is exactly the engagement/placement split the rail draws — stages 1-5 happen once per
   client, 6-9 repeat per person — so a client who already has one skips this stage entirely.

   SIGNING ORDER is the market standard for a negotiated agreement: the client signs, then ADT
   countersigns. The provider's paper is presented, the client accepts it, and the provider
   countersigns last because that is the control point — the final chance to refuse if the
   screening turned up something or a clause was altered. An agreement is executed on the LAST
   signature, and stage 6 raises the deposit invoice off that date.                        == */

   On a rebuilt counterparty stage the machine's own work and the client's correspondence share
   one column, so the reader needs one rule they learn once and never think about again:
   INDENTED MEANS THE COUNTERPARTY CAN SEE IT.

   The risk this answers is not a leak — the client never sees this screen. It is an Account
   Manager glancing at a column and not knowing which lines the client actually received. That is
   a mistake someone makes once, in front of a customer, and remembers.

   The heading appears only when the direction CHANGES. On every bubble it would be noise, and
   noise is what the reader stops reading — at which point the marking that makes this safe stops
   working. Our own notes (delivery, opens, chases) are not in the lane at all: they are things we

/* == STAGE 6: THE DEPOSIT INVOICE, AND THE GATE IT HOLDS ===================================
   The first stage on the placement track and the only one the operating model calls a hard
   gate: no hire under this client starts until the deposit is in the bank, however far the
   paperwork has got.

   IT IS A DOCUMENT, NOT A STATUS. A deposit invoice is the instrument a client's accounts
   payable department pays against, so it has to carry what one needs to pay it: who is billing
   whom, out of which registered entity, under which VAT treatment, against which agreement, by
   when, into which account, quoting which reference. A card reading "Deposit €5,700 — unpaid"
   is a status line. This is the invoice.

   EVERY NUMBER ON IT WAS DECIDED EARLIER. The amount is clause 3.4 of the agreement stage 5
   executed — one month gross salary. The terms are that agreement's "14 days net". The issue
   date is the countersignature date, because that is the event it is raised against. Nothing
   here is authored, so a renegotiated quote moves this invoice with it.

   VAT IS COMPUTED, NOT PRINTED. The invoice is issued by the ADT entity in the country the WORK
   happens in, to a client that is frequently somewhere else — the ordinary case on this platform,
   not the exception. Same country and it carries that country's VAT. Two EU countries and it is
   reverse-charged under Article 196, the client accounting for it at home. Client outside the EU
   and it falls outside the scope entirely. A flat rate printed on all three would be wrong on
   two of them, and wrong on an invoice is not a cosmetic problem.

   THE MONEY ARRIVES ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S CLOCK, like stage 3's quote. So the same machinery: a
   script that plays itself, a strip that fires the same events by hand, and a ledger that is a
   RECORD of what happened rather than an inference from the current balance.            == */

/* Where each entity is registered, what it is registered AS, and where money to it goes. Two
   addresses per country because the ADT entity and the client are both there in the cross-border
   case and printing one address twice would read as a mistake. */

/* == STAGE 7: THE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT ======================================================
   The second contract this journey produces, and a different one in every respect from the
   Master Services Agreement in stage 5. That one is between ADT and the CLIENT COMPANY, is
   commercial, states our margin, and is signed once per client. This one is between the ADT
   ENTITY and the WORKER, is an employment contract under the law of the country the work is
   done in, states none of the commercials, and is signed once per person.

   So the counterparty in the column changes. Stages 3-6 talked to the client; this talks to the
   employee, out of a separate store (`run.worker`). They must never merge — this thread discusses
   somebody's salary and probation with them, and the client's thread discusses our margin.

   == THE COMPLIANCE CHECK HAPPENS ON THE DOCUMENT ========================================
   The obvious way to render "clause compliance check" is a list of green ticks somewhere near
   the contract. That is a report ABOUT an audit; it is not the audit. What a compliance officer
   actually does is read the contract clause by clause with the statutory set beside them, and
   mark the clauses that do not meet it.

   So that is what this does. The check walks DOWN THE DOCUMENT, one clause at a time. Each
   clause takes a verdict in place, citing the Compliance Hub rule it was measured against, with
   the expected value and the drafted one. And where the draft falls short the clause is ADJUSTED
   — the text on screen changes under the reader, and the clause carries what it was changed
   from. A check that only ever agreed with the draft would not be a check.

   That is also what gives the human approval afterwards something to approve: not "the machine
   says it is fine", but "two clauses were rewritten to meet Dutch law, and here they are".

   == NOTHING HERE IS INVENTED ============================================================
   Every drafted term comes from the contract form (stage 1), and every rule it is measured
   against comes from `CCJ_STAT` or, for the minimum wage, live from the Compliance Hub's own
   Rates & Rules table via `ccjFloorFor`. Where the Hub has no rule for a country the check says
   so and returns NOT APPLICABLE, rather than inventing a threshold to pass.            == */

/* == STAGE 8: ONBOARDING ===================================================================
   Every stage before this produced ONE artefact — a quote, an account, an agreement, an invoice,
   a contract. This one produces six, and they are six genuinely different pieces of work with
   six different counterparties: an identity provider, the employee themselves, a tax authority,
   a social security institution, a bank, and our own payroll engine.

   So the screen is not a document. It is the ONBOARDING FILE: one card per workstream, the one
   currently running open in full, the finished ones collapsed to what they actually produced —
   the tax number, the enrolment reference, the account that was verified. That is how an
   onboarding tracker works in the real world, and it is the only shape that lets someone answer
   the question this screen exists to answer: can this person be paid on the first of the month.

   == WHY KYC IS RENDERED AT THIS DEPTH ===================================================
   Identity verification is the step every EOR platform claims and none of them shows. What
   actually happens is not "KYC: passed". A provider takes a document, reads its machine-readable
   zone, checks the security features for tampering, takes a live selfie, matches the face against
   the document portrait, proves the selfie is a live human and not a replay, screens the person
   against sanctions, PEP and adverse-media lists, establishes whether they may lawfully work in
   the country at all, and returns a decision with a risk score — CLEAR, CONSIDER or REJECT.

   Every one of those is on screen here, with its own result, because a customer buying this is
   buying the fact that we did them. And CONSIDER is a real outcome: where the run cannot clear
   right-to-work on its own — a non-EU national, or a visa we have been asked to sponsor — it
   stops and puts it to a person rather than passing itself.

   == NOTHING IS COUNTRY-AGNOSTIC ========================================================
   A Dutch onboarding needs a BSN and a Loonheffingen registration; a German one needs a
   Steuer-ID, an ELStAM retrieval and a DE&Uuml;V notification to a Krankenkasse; an Indian one
   needs a PAN, a UAN and an ESIC number. The checklist, the authorities, the reference formats
   and the documents all come out of CCJ_ONB, so the run shows the country's actual process
   rather than a generic six-step bar.                                                     == */

/* == STAGE 9: ACTIVE ==========================================================================
   The last stage, and the only one whose audience is the WORKER as much as the buyer. Eight
   stages have been about whether a deal can be done; this one is about whether a person can be
   paid, and then about paying them. So it answers three questions in three screens, in order:

     readiness   May this person be paid at all? Every control the journey passed, RE-DERIVED
                 from what the earlier stages actually recorded — not re-asserted. A control
                 whose evidence is missing fails here, and a failed control blocks the run.
     payrun      What were they actually paid? The register: inputs, gross to net, what is owed
                 to the tax authority and the social security institution, funding, the payment
                 file, and the payslip. Then a person releases it.
     active      What is true now? The employment record, and the whole nine-stage trail with
                 the artefact each stage produced.

   THE CERTIFICATE IS DERIVED, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT. Every row on it reads the object the
   stage that produced it wrote — ccjMsa(), ccjPay(), ccjEmp(), ccjOnb() — and states its source,
   its reference and the time that object recorded. Nothing on it is authored per run, so it
   cannot claim a control that did not happen. That is what makes it worth showing a worker.

   NOTHING PRINTS A TIME NOBODY RECORDED. Where the underlying object has no timestamp the row
   shows its reference alone. Synthesising `something + 40 minutes` is the bug the stage-6 ledger
   and the stage-7 envelope both had, and it is worse here: this is the document that says the
   controls were real.

   THE MONEY DOES NOT MOVE ON A TIMER. First payroll run parks TWICE — once on the register being
   complete, where Finance releases it, and again on the disbursement actually finishing. That is
   why CCJ_HOLDS accepts a function: one step, two milestones, a human decision between them. */

/* ---- WHAT A PAYROLL RUN IS, PER COUNTRY ----------------------------------------------------
   The monthly return, who it goes to, the contribution filing beside it, the rail the money
   travels on, and the elements the country adds that a flat gross-to-net would miss. The
   accruals matter: vakantiegeld, TFR, pagas extraordinarias and gratuity are earned in THIS
   period and paid in another one, so they belong on the payslip as accruals and nowhere near
   net pay. Printing them as earnings would overstate what lands in the account. */

/* == THIS JOURNEY DOES NOT RUN PAYROLL ====================================================
   It used to. This step built a register, asked Finance to RELEASE money, moved it, filed two
   statutory returns and issued a payslip — and that was wrong about what the journey is for. The
   user's instruction, 2026-08-03: *"we are giving the access, and then initially the payroll status
   will be in pending, and at the final step we are making the payroll status pending to active."*

   So the step keeps everything that is PREPARATION — access, the calendar, the period, the inputs,
   the gross-to-net figure and the pre-payroll controls — and loses everything that is EXECUTION.
   No money moves, no return is filed, no payslip is issued, and nobody is asked to release
   anything, because there is nothing to release. It ends with the payroll record created and its
   status PENDING; the last sub-status flips that to ACTIVE.

   Payroll itself then runs on its own calendar, which is what stage 9's own closing note has said
   all along: "Active is the end of this journey and the start of a recurring one."

   The gross-to-net figure stays and stays INDICATIVE. It is the most useful thing on the screen —
   it is what this person will actually receive — and computing it is not the same as paying it. */

   `ccjRun` STAYS THE ACTIVE RUN. It is read in hundreds of places and renaming it would be a
   change to everything for the benefit of nothing. What is new is `ccjRuns`: a store keyed by
   deal, holding the SAME objects. Switching is a reassignment of ccjRun to a member of the store,
   so every mutation anywhere still lands on the right run with no plumbing.

   PARKING IS ABOUT CLOCKS, NOT STATE. ccjSchedule already refuses to fire when `ccjRun !== run`,
   so a parked run cannot write into the active one — that guard was here before this feature and
   is what makes the whole thing safe. But a pending timer would still fire on RETURN, when
   ccjRun points at it again, delivering a beat armed minutes ago. So parking stops the clocks and

   (`settled`, `decisions`, `stepMsgs`) and its block pushed through ccjPush, so the transcript,
   the rail, the screens and the drawer all derive from state exactly as they do on a walked run.
   Summaries come from ccjSummary against the seeded artefacts — the same sentence a walked run
   would have recorded — with 'Done' only where a summary needs state this seed does not build.

   THE LIVE STEP IS NOT SEEDED. run.stage/run.sub are set and ccjEnterStep does what it always
   does — halts on its gate, parks on its wait, or runs its actions. From the reader's first
   moment the run is live, not a replay.

   MONEY IS THE DEAL'S, DIVIDED HONESTLY. `value` is the annual engagement value across every

/* == RUNS THAT OUTLIVE THE TAB =============================================================
   Called by persistAppState/loadAppState in js/core.js, which owns the snapshot.

   TWO THINGS IN A RUN CANNOT BE WRITTEN DOWN, and both are dropped rather than stored:

     stream.el   a live DOM node. It would serialise to `{}` and come back as an object that is
                 not the element on the page, which ccjStreamSync compares against and would
                 rebuild from — so storing it buys a stale pointer and nothing else. Cleared, and
                 the first sync after a reload does a full render, which is correct.
     timers      ids belonging to a page that no longer exists. Restoring one would either clear
                 an unrelated timer that happens to have the same id, or wait for a callback that
                 can never come. Nulled, and ccjResumeRun re-arms whatever the run was mid-way
                 through when it is next opened.

   Everything else in a run is plain data and survives as written. == */
